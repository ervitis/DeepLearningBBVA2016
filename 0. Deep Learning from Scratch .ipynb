    "\n",
    "Deep learning is one of the fastest growing areas of machine learning and a hot topic in both academia and industry. This course will cover the basics of deep learning by using a hands-on approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "We will illustrate all contents with Jupyter notebooks, a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Audience\n",
    "This course is targeted for developers, data scientists and researchers that have a basic knowledge of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Minimal experience on Python programming, basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory. Attendees are expected to bring their own laptops for the hands-on practical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who\n",
    "This course is organized by the Data Science Group @ UB\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTRUCTORS: Oriol Pujol, Associate Professor at UB. Santi Seguí, Lecturer at UB. Jordi Vitrià. Full Professor at UB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n",
    "+ Describe how a neural network works and combine different types of layers and activation functions.\n",
    "+ Describe how these models can be applied in computer vision, text analytics, etc.\n",
    "+ Develop your own models in Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics\n",
